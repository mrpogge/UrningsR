#' urningsR: Simulation and data analysis using algorithms for adaptive learning systems
#'
#'
#' This package contains function with which one can simulate the behaviour of
#' adaptive learning systems, and can analyse exsisting datasets coming from
#' adaptive learning systesms. The focus of the package is the Urnings algorithm,
#'  and its variants for response time and multidimensional data, but it also
#'  includes wrappers for the Elo rating system.

#' @section Simulation methods:
#'
#' \emph{urnings_game_sim}: sets the simulation environment for unidimensional Urnings
#'
#' \emph{urnings_game_rt_sim}: sets the simulation environment for Urnings with response time
#'
#' \emph{mv_urnings_game_sim}:sets the simulation environment for multidimensional Urnings
#'
#' \emph{simulate}: executes the simulation
#'
#' @section Data analysis methods:
#'
#' \emph{urnings_game}: sets the environment for unidimensional Urnings
#'
#' \emph{urnings_game_rt}: sets the environment for Urnings with response time
#'
#' \emph{mv_urnings_game}:sets the environment for multidimensional Urnings
#'
#' \emph{analyse}: executes the the analysis
